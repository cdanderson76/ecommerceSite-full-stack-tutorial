CHALLENGE: Database Setup


1. Create a MongoDB database (instructions in the thumb drive). Grab the connection string,
   and add it to the '.env' file.

   NOTE: THIS MAY ALREADY BE CREATED, SO JUST CONNECT THE DATABASE


2. Create '/backend/lib/db.js' and connect the MongoDB database.  Use a try/catch for this,
   and console log the connection once connected.  Use 'Error connecting to MongoDB', and
   then use the 'message' error method and exit the process gracefully to keep it from
   crashing.

   In the MongoDB URI, use the 'ecommerce_db' endpoint


   You've completed this challenge when you see that you have successfully connected to the
   database.
