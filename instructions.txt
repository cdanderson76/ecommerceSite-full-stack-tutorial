CHALLENGE: Controller and Starting Routes


1. Create a folder called 'routes', and one called 'controllers' in the 'backend directory.
   Inside of the 'routes' folder, create a file called 'auth.route.js'.


2. Create a router in 'auth.route.js' file and have it exported.  Create an endpoint called
   'signup' by way of the get method, and have it render to the browser 'Signup route called'.

   Import this route into 'server.js' to make this happen.  Change the current 'get' route
   to use this imported route.  Call this imported route 'authRoutes'.  Test this out by going
   to 'http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup' in the browser.

3. Repeat the previous process for 'login' and 'logout' routes.  No need to put these into
   'server.js' right now.  Test these routes out in the browser to ensure they come up with the
   appropriate text.


4. Create a file called '/controllers/auth.controller.js', and use the routes as async
   functions into 'auth.controller.js' from 'auth.route.js'.  You WILL have to import the
   name of the variables back into 'auth.route.js' when finished.

   
   Test out the routes in the browser to ensure that they are working.
