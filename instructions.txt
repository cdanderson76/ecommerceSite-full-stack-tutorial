CHALLENGE: BACKEND SETUP

1. Create your root folder on the desktop, and then create your 'backend' folder and your
   'frontend' folder.  Put a dummy file in the 'frontend' folder just so you can push it
   to github.


2. Create your 'package.json' file in the root directory of this project.  Install the following
   packages:  Express, Mongoose, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, stripe, cloudinary, cookie-parser,
   bcryptjs, ioredis (9 total)


3. Install 'nodemon' and ensure that is installed so that it is not pushed to production.

   Modify the 'package.json' file to use 'nodemon' and to have the ability to use imports.
   Also, create your 'server.js' file in your 'backend' directory.  Create your Express app
   (you should know how to do this without details now).

   Ensure that you log something to the browser and the console to ensure the server is working


4. In 'package.json' include a development start up script that is used for production
   alongside the other that you created for 'nodemon'.  Use 'node' for this one.


5. Create a '.env' file, store the port number there, and then use it inside of the
   'server.js' file, rather than the hard-coded 5000.  Do write a conditional to hardcode
   the port number if the port number from the '.env' file is unavailable.
