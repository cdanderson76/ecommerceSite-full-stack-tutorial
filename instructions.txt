CHALLENGE: Authentication 3

NOTE:  YOU WILL NEED TO ADD YOUR MONGODB URI TO THE '.env' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!
       YOU WILL NEED YOUR REDIS URL BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Go to the '.env' file, and use the variable 'ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET' to store the access token
   secret.  Use 'access_token' for now.  Do the same for 'REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET'.  


2. Remove the 'await redis.set' line within the 'redis.js' file.  Go into the 
   'auth.controller.js' file and generate both the refresh token and access token.

   Have the access token expire in 15 minutes (15*60*1000)
   Have the refresh token expire in 7 days (7*24*60*60)

   NOTE:  MINUTES ARE DETERMINED BY MILLISECONDS (1 MINUTE = 60,000 MILLISECONDS) 


3. Save the refresh and access tokens to the database and set it into the cookie.  Ensure that 
   you set it up to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks

   Modify the 201 return status to show the name, email, ID, and role of the user
