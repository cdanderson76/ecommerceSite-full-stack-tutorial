CHALLENGE: Authentication 2

NOTE:  YOU WILL NEED TO ADD YOUR MONGODB URI TO THE '.env' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Create a Redis database (instructions how to do so are on the thumb drive)


2. Create '/backend/lib/redis.js' and paste in the code that you copied fromthe redis
   database.  Cut out the string in the 'Redis' method that you see there, and put it inside
   of the '.env' file.  You can call the variable 'UPSTASH_REDIS_URL'.

   NOTE: ENSURE YOU REMOVE THE QUOTES

   Pull this environment variable into the 'redis.js' file


3. Run this file by using the following (be in the ROOT directory):

   node .\backend\lib\redis.js.

   If done correctly, you should see something similar to the illustration in Anki
